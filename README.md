## What This Code Does
This c++-code implements a ride-sharing (anti)-coordination game as proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11079

The present code version realizes a minimal simulation of the replicator dynamics for one set of parameters
defined in the game (S,epsilon,zeta,xi). It repeatedly solves, amongst others, a maximum weight matching problem
to pair shared ride requests. For this purpose, it embeds the 'Blossom V' algorithm proposed by Vladimier
Kolmogorov in "Mathematical Programming Computation (MPC), July 2009, 1(1): 43-67.'
